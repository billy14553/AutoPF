# Automated Preprocessing Framework
This repository contains the code of the following paper 

An automated preprocessing framework for near infrared
spectroscopic data.

# Dependencies
In order to run, the code requires the following Matlab modules:
  * libPLS: an Integrated Library for Partial Least Squares Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis,https://www.libpls.net/
  * PLS_Toolbox from Eigenvector Research, https://eigenvector.com/software/pls-toolbox/

  
 

# Quickstart
* Install libPLS
* Install PLS_Toolbox (v701 for our paper), we believe other versions of PLS_Toolbox (even earlier version) also work for this code.
* Run the `demo.m` to see how to use this source code
* Run the `scriptForPaper.m` to obtain the results of this paper
